# CPSC474-Project2
Project 2 for Distributing Computing

We will solve this using: Franklinâ€™s algorithm (week8_1 slides).

We will start by using 5 number of processes, where 0 to 4 are the IDs.

0 has neighbors: 1 and 2 (1 on the left, 2 on the right).  
1 has neighbors: 3 and 0  
2 has neighbors: 0 and 4  
3 has neighbors: 4 and 1  
4 has neighbors: 3 and 2
